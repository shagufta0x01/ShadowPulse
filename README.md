   cd dashboard
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create an administrator account**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the dashboard**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Running the Web Application

The ShadowPulse Scanner web application is built with Django and provides a comprehensive interface for security assessment and vulnerability management.

#### Development Mode

1. **Start the Django Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   This will start the development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

2. **Access the Web Interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Log in with your administrator account
   - You'll be redirected to the main dashboard

#### Production Mode

1. **Configure Production Settings**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure settings
   - Set secure passwords and a proper secret key
   - Configure allowed hosts for your domain

2. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Development mode
   docker-compose up -d

   # Production mode
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Start the web application, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, and Nginx

   cd dashboard
   python manage.py collectstatic
   gunicorn dashboard.wsgi_prod:application
   ```

6. **Docker Deployment Documentation**
   - See `DOCKER_README.md` for detailed Docker deployment instructions
   - Includes configuration, management, and troubleshooting information

## ü§ñ Agent Deployment

The ShadowPulse Scanner uses an agent-based architecture where the agent component runs on target systems and communicates with the central dashboard. The agent can be deployed as either a Python module or a standalone executable.

### Building the Agent Executable

The agent can now be built as a standalone executable, eliminating the need for Python to be installed on target systems.

1. **Using the Build Script**
   ```bash
   # Run the build script
   python build_agent_exe.py

   # Or use the batch file on Windows
   build_agent.bat
   ```

2. **What the Build Process Does**
   - Checks for and installs required dependencies (PyInstaller, scapy, mac_vendor_lookup, wmi)
   - Creates a temporary entry point script
   - Packages all necessary files into a single executable
   - Places the executable in the current directory

3. **Build Requirements**
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - Internet connection (for downloading dependencies)
   - PyInstaller (installed automatically if missing)
   - Sufficient disk space (~50-100MB for the build process)

### Running the Agent

1. **Using the Executable**
   ```bash
   # Simply run the executable
   agent_listener.exe
   ```

2. **Using Python Module (Alternative)**
   ```bash
   # Run as a Python module
   python -m proto.agent.agent_listener
   ```

3. **Verifying Operation**
   - The agent will display `[+] Agent listening on 0.0.0.0:23033` when started successfully
   - The HTTP server will show `[HTTP] Server started on http://0.0.0.0:23033`
   - The agent is now ready to accept connections from the dashboard

### Agent Configuration

1. **Network Configuration**
   - The agent listens on port 23033 by default (both TCP socket and HTTP)
   - Ensure this port is accessible from the dashboard system
   - Firewall rules may need to be adjusted to allow incoming connections

2. **Security Considerations**
   - The agent provides access to system information and should only be run on trusted systems
   - Consider network segmentation to limit access to the agent
   - The agent does not implement authentication by default; use network security measures

3. **Connecting from Dashboard**
   - Add the agent's IP address as a target in the dashboard
   - The dashboard will automatically connect to the agent on port 23033
   - Verify connectivity by running a basic scan from the dashboard

### Configuration

#### Dashboard Configuration
Edit `dashboard/dashboard/settings.py` to customize:
- Database settings
- Authentication options
- Email notifications
- Logging preferences
- Security settings

#### Agent Configuration
Edit `agent/config.ini` on target systems to set:
- Controller connection details
- Scan permissions
- Resource usage limits
- Logging options
- Self-protection features

## üìö Technical Documentation

### How the System Works

ShadowPulse Scanner operates as a client-server system with three main components:

1. **Dashboard (Web Interface)**
   - Django-based web application that provides the user interface
   - Manages targets, scans, and results
   - Visualizes security data and generates reports
   - Communicates with agents through the host controller

2. **Host Controller**
   - Manages communication between the dashboard and agents
   - Sends commands to agents and processes responses
   - Implements the client side of the ZAMBOT protocol
   - Located in `proto/host/host_controller.py`

3. **Agent**
   - Runs on target systems to collect security information
   - Implements various security assessment modules
   - Provides both socket and HTTP interfaces
   - Can be run as Python module or standalone executable
   - Located in `proto/agent/agent_listener.py`

### Application Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   - User accesses the dashboard web interface
   - Adds target systems (IP addresses where agents are running)
   - Initiates scans or security assessments

2. **Command Execution**
   - Dashboard sends command to host controller
   - Host controller formats command using ZAMBOT protocol
   - Command is sent to the appropriate agent
   - Agent processes command and returns results
   - Results are displayed in the dashboard

3. **Data Storage**
   - Scan results are stored in the database
   - Vulnerabilities and security issues are tracked
   - Historical data is maintained for trend analysis

### Agent-Controller Protocol

The system uses a custom binary protocol (ZAMBOT) for efficient and reliable communication between the controller and agents:

#### Protocol Overview

- **Name**: ZAMBOT Protocol
- **Transport**: TCP (port 23033 by default)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Connection Problems**
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check firewall rules for port 23033
   - Ensure agent service is running
   - Validate controller address configuration

2. **Dashboard Access Issues**
   - Confirm web server is running
   - Verify database connection
   - Check authentication credentials
   - Review server logs for errors

3. **Scan Failures**
   - Ensure target system is accessible
   - Verify agent has necessary permissions
   - Check for antivirus/security software blocking scans
   - Review scan timeout settings for complex scans

4. **Agent Executable Issues**
   - If the agent executable fails to start, check for missing dependencies
   - Some antivirus software may flag the executable; add an exception
   - Ensure the executable has appropriate permissions
   - Try running as administrator if access issues occur
   - If the executable crashes, check the logs for error messages

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Checking Agent Status**
   ```bash
   # Check if agent is running
   netstat -ano | findstr 23033

   # View agent logs
   # Logs are printed to console when running the executable
   ```

2. **Testing Dashboard-Agent Communication**
   ```bash
   # From the dashboard server
   telnet <agent-ip> 23033

   # Or use the test connection utility
   python -m proto.host.host_controller --target <agent-ip> --command 1
   ```

3. **Debugging the Agent Executable**
   - Run the executable from command prompt to see console output
   - Look for error messages during startup
   - Verify all required files are present in the executable directory
   - Verify agent has sufficient permissions
   - Check for resource constraints
   - Review scan logs for specific errors
